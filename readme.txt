"Hey friends, I've just posted a new project on Python3 - a currency converter using an API. Check it out! in  @Web_learnersX


IMPORTANT: Before running the program, please make sure to register for an account here: https://app.exchangerate-api.com/sign-in and paste the generated API key in the 'api_key' field. Without this step, the program will not work. If you don't know how to register, you can use my key for some time, but keep in mind that using someone else's key without their permission is not ideal. Let me know if you have any questions. Happy coding! üêç"
